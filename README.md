# rust-practice
Practicing various algorithms & tutorial projects with Rust, including:

+ Exercises from the Rust Book [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
+ Assignments from Princeton's Algorithms, Part I course on Coursera [https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
  + Course is taught in Java, but wanted more practice applying Rust ownership/memory management paradigm to the foundational data structures & algorithms.
